**what is recursion?**
--------------------------------
Any function which calls itself is called **recursive**. \n
**Recursion: Process of solving a problem by reducing it to smaller versions of itself.**
A recursive method solves a problem by calling a copy of itself to work on a smaller problem. This is called the recursion step. The
recursion step can result in many more such _recursive calls_.
It is important to ensure that the recursion terminates. Each time the function calls itself with a
slightly simpler version of the original problem. The sequence of smaller problems must
eventually converge on the _base case_ .
